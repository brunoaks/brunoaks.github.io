Hello, friend!

I'm Brazilian undergraduate student at the Polythenic School of the University of SÃ£o Paulo, majoring in Industrial Engineering. I discovered the world of Data Science just recently, when I was in my exchange year in Tokyo, but I became instantly obsessed with it! I believe the advancements in data processing and Machine Learning are changing the world as we know it in a remarkable way, and I want to be part of this.

I created this blog to help other beginners and enthusiasts in the field to gain some insights and motivation to also initiate their careers in this exciting world. I plan on sharing personal project guidelines, reviews for online courses and study materials, and any other interesting content related to Data Science, Analytics and Machine Learning. I hope you find some of the content useful.

### Why did I create this page

I felt like exposing some of my work, so that I could share some knowledge with the world ~~and boost my ego~~.

My code is always available on [Github](https://github.com/brunoaks). I focus on doing analysis with Data Science tools and messing around with Machine Learning models.

My articles are _usually_ cross-posted on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-koba/). I write about big issues, or meaningful personal experiences.

My photos are only around here. I shoot with an Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark III mirrorless, and use Adobe Lightroom for editing purposes.

I hope you can learn a thing or two by exploring this website a little.

### More about me

Besides the topics mentioned above, I have a special interest in meditation, discussing politics, reading about tech trends or travelling to exotic places (India and Japan are probably my favourite destinations yet). I prefer summers over winters, Star Wars over Star Trek and Android over iOS.

Also, I believe that commercial trips to Mars will be viable within some decades, the Generation Z will live until 150 years and superintelligent AI is the most important topic we should all be discussing right now.
