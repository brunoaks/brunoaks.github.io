        In short, I'm a Brazilian undergrad student in Industrial Engineering at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. I have a plethora of different interests, 
        and I hope this webpage helps you figure out who I am and where to find me.

        Writing about big issues is one of my passions. I use three main platforms: <a href="https://medium.com/@brunoaks">Medium</a> for all kinds of articles, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-koba/">LinkedIn</a> for a more "professional" subset of my Medium production, and <a href="https://twitter.com/brunoaks">Twitter</a>, for sharing quick opinions and thoughts.
        I'm very interested in developmental economics, world history and the future of technology. I believe putting these ideas on paper is the best way for me to truly understand them, and of course, to share my knowledge with the world.

        I also take pictures. You can take a look at some of my shots in my <a href="https://500px.com/brunoaks">500px</a> account. I use an Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark III to shoot, and Adobe Lightroom for editing.
        Most of my pictures are from trips I took - I'm passionate about exploring places with exotic cultures and sights, and being able to capture unique moments from those places is incredibly rewarding.

        And of course, I also have big professional ambitions! I'm passionate about data science, and my dream is to build a very complete analytical skillset and work with an inspiring engineering team in order to build amazing products in the tech industry.
        I have a Data Science and Machine Learning  <a href="http://brunokoba.com/blog/">blog</a>, and you can also check out my <a href="https://github.com/brunoaks">Github</a> account.

        I'd say I'm a bottomless pit for learning new things. There are so many other interests of mine that I wanted to share with you, such as 
        meditation, Brazilian poetry and investment strategies, but I fear this page is already longer than it should be. 
        Why don't you shoot me an <a href="mailto:brunoaks@gmail.com">email</a> so that we can talk better?

      <p>Thanks for reading until the end, and peace out! </p>
