        I'm an undergrad student in Industrial Engineering at the University of SÃ£o Paulo with a lot of different interests.
        I hope this webpage helps you figure out who I am and where to find me.

        When I have time, I write on <a href="https://medium.com/@brunoaks">Medium</a>, sometimes cross-posting on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-koba/">LinkedIn</a> profile. I also active on <a href="https://twitter.com/brunoaks">Twitter</a>, which I think is a fantastic platform for valuable content consumption.
        Big issues interest me. I'm very curious in developmental economics, world politics and the future of technology. And I believe putting these ideas on paper is the best way for me to memorize them, and of course, to share my knowledge with the world.
        I don't write that often. But when I do, I make sure to put some serious effort on it.

        I'm also interested in photography, and you can take a look at some of my shots in my <a href="https://500px.com/brunoaks">500px</a> account. I use an Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark III to shoot, and Adobe Lightroom for editing.
        Most of my pictures are from trips I took. I'm passionate about exploring places with exotic cultures and sights, and being able to capture unique moments from those places is incredibly rewarding.

        And of course, I also have big professional ambitions! I'm passionate about data science, and I intend to hone my analytical skills and work with an inspiring engineering team in order to build great products in the tech industry. 
        I believe we are living a very exciting moment in the tech industry. My long-term dream is to become a reference in product development and be able create meaningful impact to people around the world.
